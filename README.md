The changes that I made were to comments out a lot of the unused defines in my .h files
I created an enumeration for the different states that I could have, instead of having 0x1, 0x2, 0x4, and 0x8 be the definition for all of them
I added a log.h file to define the different operating states of LOG for debug and release
Clean up comments throughout my code
I added overall file and functions comments/documentation to better explain the flow of my code
